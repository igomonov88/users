// migrations contains the queries needed to construct the database schema.
// Entries should never be removed from this slice once they have been ran in
// production.
//
// Using constants in a .go file is an easy way to ensure the queries are part
// of the compiled executable and avoids pathing issues with the working
// directory. It has the downside that it lacks syntax highlighting and may be
// harder to read for some cases compared to using .sql files. You may also
// consider a combined approach using a tool like packr or go-bindata.
